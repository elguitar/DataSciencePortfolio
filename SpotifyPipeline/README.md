# Spotify Pipeline

This is a proof of my skills regarding data engineering.

## Objective

To have some kind of goal to this project, I have to determine the objective which I should achieve or at least get closer and closer to.

Based on what I consider interesting, I have decided to build a pipeline around [the Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/). I would like to generate analysis about how my listening habits have changed over time, what are my "hot" hours and stuff like that. I should not think too much about the analysis phase to focus on the data engineering.

## Some premises

- I would like to be able to update the data daily. Also, I would like to be able to backfill the data from the past.

## Tech used

- [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org)
- [Spotipy library](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.16.1/)
